      subject: Use combined stream version 1.
      body: We had moved to combined stream v2 when img-maker was using node streams
        v2, but we don't need them anymore, and for some reason combined stream
        does not work with the streams returned by aws sdk s3 library.

      subject: Increase code clarity
      body: |-
        Functions that prepare buffers now just concatenate buffers
        making them easier to read.
        Also create function made cleaner by calculating the file
        header offset at the right time (instead of too early as it was before).

      subject: Add DEFLATE_END block to the end of each entry.
      body: |-
        This allows all deflate parts to be the same, and have the same
        format as gzip-stream.
        This was supposed to be part of 0.1.0 but was accidentally not
        included.
        Tests were passing because of a failure in the test framework,
        it wasn't actually running the expect() checks. Tests are fixed
        and now automatically generate all the required files instead
        of pre-generating them as was done until now.

      subject: Use combined-stream2 library
      body: >-
        combined-stream2 is compatible with Streams v2 API, and therefore plays

        nicer with the libraries we use in our services, for example

        event-stream.

        This fixes an issue we have currently on image-maker, where event-stream

        writes too much data to the zip library, before that is able to write it

        to the response, throwing "CombinedStream#maxDataSize max data size exceeded".
